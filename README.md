About Project:

The internship at Dynamic Traffic System primarily involved computer
software development to create an advanced, web-based intelligent traffic
management system. The work encompassed designing and implementing an
intuitive web application interface to enable real-time monitoring and analysis of
traffic video streams from multiple cameras. State-of-the-art computer vision 
models, such as YOLOv8, were integrated into the system to achieve high-
accuracy vehicle detection and classification. To ensure efficient real-time 
performance, these deep learning models were optimized and deployed on edge
AI hardware, specifically NVIDIA Jetson platforms, using technologies like
DeepStream and TensorRT.

A significant portion of the work focused on building interactive
dashboards and data visualization tools to surface actionable insights from the
vast amount of traffic data processed by the system. This involved working with
technologies like React, python, OpenCV and yoloV8 to create a user-friendly
and visually compelling front-end interface. Furthermore, software components
were developed to seamlessly manage and orchestrate the various parts of the
intelligent traffic system, ensuring smooth integration with existing transportation
infrastructure. The work spanned multiple domains, including full-stack software
engineering, AI and machine learning model development, edge computing
optimization, UI/UX design, and the application of domain knowledge in traffic
management. The internship provided an invaluable opportunity to contribute to
the end-to-end development of an advanced, AI-powered software application
aimed at enabling safer and more efficient urban mobility.
